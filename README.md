# Shadowboard
### Two-Player Tactical Game
Shadowboard is a strategy game played on a chessboard-like grid, where chess pieces are replaced by characters with different abilities and stats.

The battlefield is limited by each character's individual visibility zone, adding a stealth and detection layer to the gameplay.

Players can choose up to three different heroes to form their team, combining their unique skills and strategies to defeat opponent.

### Character Stats:
* Health (HP)
* Damage
* Vision Range
* Movement Range (Number of cells the character can move per turn)
* Attack Range (Distance for attacking enemies)
